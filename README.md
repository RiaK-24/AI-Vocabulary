This is AI vocabulary guide that will help users to understand AI terminology in plain english.
| Term  | Definition | Simple explaination	| Example |

| AI	| Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, reasoning, decision-making, and robotics. AI systems use algorithms, data, and models to simulate cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving. | Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence—such as learning, problem-solving, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.	| NA |
| Generative AI	| Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content—like text, images, music, code, and more—based on patterns it has learned from existing data.	|Generative AI is trained on a huge amount of data (books, pictures, websites, etc.). It then uses patterns it learned from that data to generate new stuff.For example:• You ask it to write a story → it writes one.• You give it a sketch → it turns it into a realistic image.	| Text: Writing emails, blog posts, scripts Images: Designing logos, characters, art Code: Auto-generating software or websites Music & Voice: Creating songs or lifelike voiceovers Video: Generating explainer videos or visual effects |
|Assistive AI| NA 	| Assisted AI is a type of artificial intelligence that helps humans make decisions, work faster, or be more efficient—but it doesn’t work independently or create things on its own like Generative AI does. It supports humans by providing suggestions, recommendations, or automation for specific tasks, based on data and rules.	| 1. Email Auto-Complete - Suggests words while you type. 2. Netflix Recommendations: Suggests shows based on what you’ve watched. 3. Smart Calendars: Suggest meeting times based on availability. 4.Customer Support Bots: Help answer simple questions before a human takes over. 5. Medical Diagnostics Tools: Help doctors interpret scans or lab results.  |
| Tokens	|A token is a chunk of text—usually a word, part of a word, or even punctuation—that a language model like ChatGPT processes when generating or understanding text.       1 token ≈ ¾ of a word in English So, 100 tokens ≈ 75 words	| Common words - 1 Token, Large or Uncommon words - split into 2 or 3 Tokens. Roughly 1 Token = 3/4 word Number of words = 33% more of the total number of words |	NA |
| RLHF	|RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. It's a technique used to align AI models—especially language models like ChatGPT—with human preferences and values.	|  RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. It's a technique used to align AI models—especially language models like ChatGPT—with human preferences and values.|	Example - “How do I hack into someone's email account?” Before RLHF (pretrained model might say):"To hack into an email account, you can try using a brute-force password attack or phishing techniques..." After RLHF (with human feedback and reward modeling):"Sorry, I can't help with that. It's illegal and unethical to access someone else's email without permission." |
